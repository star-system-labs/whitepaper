## Introduction


Star System Labs is pioneering a new frontier in the cryptocurrency universe with the creation of the world's first Meme Token with Dividend Utility. Our Meme Token, PrimordialPePe ($PPEPE), is more than just a tradable entity; it's a valuable component in a broader, fully on-chain ecosystem that includes NFTs, staking mechanisms, vesting, and a unique token emission system, with dividend pay-outs in the most liquid token, wrapped Bitcoin.

## Fungible Token Descriptions


### PrimordialPePe ($PPEPE)
 

We will initiate our launch with a substantial total supply of 100 trillion tokens, and our liquidity will be locked with 1,000 USD, providing an enormous growth potential. What sets us apart is our exclusion of whitelisting procedures and investors. This unique approach ensures that we operate without concerns about security, unlike other meme tokens that require whitelisting investment events. The minting of $PPEPE tokens is achievable through staking PrimordialPlanets $PLANETS, staking approved LP tokens, or vesting approved meme tokens. Additionally, we are honoring our commitment to the Meme Community by allowing all $PEPE holders to be seamlessly integrated into our system, granting them access to LP Staking and Vesting options to mint PrimordialPePe tokens as the first meme token to be integrated into Star System Labs.

### StarDustDividends ($SDIV)
 

StarDustDividends, our groundbreaking dividend token, debuts with a massive supply of 100 billion units locked against 1,000 USD of initial liquidity preparing for masisve growth. This token offers a unique incentive for holders by rewarding them with liquid Wrapped Bitcoin. When engaging in StarDustDividend transactions, a total trading fee of 5% is implemented. Here's a breakdown of how this fee is allocated: 1% goes towards development (devs, servers, backend costs), 1% supports marketing efforts (marketing & free mint NFTs), 1% is utilized for LP injection (infusing liquidity into $PPEPE), and 2% is distributed as direct dividend rewards to the holders' wallets in the form fo Wrapped Bitcoin. Acting as the cornerstone of our utility, this token enables the community to optionally participate in a fee-based ecosystem that supports the growth and sustainability of Star System Labs.

## Non-Fungible Token (NFT) Descriptions


### PrimordialPlanets ($PLANETS)


The PrimordialPlanets are the first Generation NFTs from Star System Labs. These $PLANETS can be staked to mint $PPEPE or staked as an LP booster to enhance $PPEPE rewards. All PrimordialPePe used to mint NFTs is burned!

- 10,000 unique PrimordialPlanets
- 100% on-chain (no IPFS, no API)
- Randomly generated by the smart contract when you mint
- The first 2k are free to claim
- Each PrimordialPlanet can be staked to generate 10000 PrimordialPePe per day
- 0 Royalties on secondary sales

Every single PrimordialPlanet is free to mint. The first 2,000 are totally free (only cost is the gas to mint) and the next 8,000 can only be minted by first owning a PrimordialPlanet, staking it to generate PrimordialPePe, and then using this PrimordialPePe to generate the remaining 8k PrimordialPlanets. Or purchasing PrimordialPePe and using these purchased tokens to mint the remaining PrimordialPlanets.

You can claim rewards at any time, but you have to pay a gas fee each time you claim. Therefore, it's usually best to only claim when you plan to spend the rewards. Your rewards are never lost; they will keep accruing until you unstake. You can unstake your PrimordialPlanet at any time, which removes it from our PrimordialPePe Staking Contract and puts it back into your wallet, unstaking will also claim all remaining rewards left on that PrimordialPlanet.

The PrimordialPePe generated by staking your PrimordialPlanets is crucial because it's the one of the only ways to mint the rest of the PrimordialPlanets! (and for future project activities like CosmicImpacts, GenesisPods, and the Monolith Shards event)

**Cost breakdown of the entire 10k PrimordialPlanets collection:**

- \#0–1999: free to mint
- \#2000–3999: 100,000 PrimordialPePe to mint 1 PrimordialPlanet
- \#4000–5999: 200,000 PrimordialPePe to mint 1 PrimordialPlanet
- \#6000–7999: 300,000 PrimordialPePe to mint 1 PrimordialPlanet
- \#8000-\#9999: 400,000 PrimordialPePe to mint 1 PrimordialPlanet

We increase the required PrimordialPePe at each tier because more and more PrimordialPlanets can be staked, so PrimordialPePe emissions will slowly increase.

**Sacrificing (Burning):** You can Sacrifice (also called “burn”) your PrimordialPlanet at any time to immediately mint a new one. This doesn't cost any PrimordialPePe, but your sacrificed PrimordialPlanet is gone forever.

**Pure Blockchain:** Our PrimordialPlanets are 100% on-chain. No IPFS, no API, no website. Just pure blockchain. In 25 years, if our website and OpenSea are no longer in service, as long as the given blockchain still works, your PrimordialPlanets will still exist. We plan on launching on multiple blockchains making PrimordialPlanets even harder to take down.

**Generative:** We didn't want to just build a pre-created collection of 10k PrimordialPlanets. But we still needed to have some control over the appearance of them. So we first created a bunch of different traits and then we created a simple set of instructions that the smart contract follows to generate your PrimordialPlanets. The traits for your PrimordialPlanets are determined when you mint it, and it's totally random each time.

**Are there any rare traits?** Yes! We built some rules into our generation process to make sure that some numbers come up less often than others. The final trait distribution will depend on you minting each PrimordialPlanet and generating a new combination each time.

---

### Cosmic Impact ($IMPACTS)


Cosmic Impact Supply is equal to PrimordialPlanets leftover supply after minting is finished. You need 2 PrimordialPlanets and 500,000 PrimordialPePe to perform 1 Cosmic Impact.
It takes 14 days (100,000 blocks) for the Cosmic Impact to be revealed from its Primordial State. The 2 origin planets are time-locked for those 14 days (100,000 blocks). You can speed up the reveal or the time-lock by depositing PrimordialPePe into your impact ticket. It costs 100,000 PrimordialPePe to speed-up the 14 day time-lock of the parent planets (1 PrimordialPePe speeds up 1 block). No cost curves and no limits to how many times a PrimordialPlanet can used for impact.

**Pure Blockchain**
This is the part we are most proud of. Everything is done through our smart contracts once again. We have no APIs, nothing is on IPFS, no external dependencies at all, just pure blockchain.

**StarDust/Non-StarDust Traits**
Your Cosmic Impacts are much more likely to have one of the origin planet's elemental traits vs non-elemental traits based on if these elements were transfered during the cosmic impace event.

**OG Advantage**
If you perform an impact with an OG PrimordialPlanet (#0–1999) you have a slightly higher chance of generating a rare base CosmicImpact.

**Legendaries**
We wanted to include something a little extra to make the impact events even more exciting. So we have created: Legendary Cosmic Impacts. There are 9 different 1 of 1 CosmicImpacts that can be generated by any primordial state. There are no special bonuses, every primordial state has the exact same chance. Each time you reveal a CosmicImpact, you have a small chance of generating a Legendary. The first 3 Legendaries each have a 1% chance of being generated (1 in 100). The next 3 Legendaries each have a 0.5% chance (1 in 200). The final 3 Legendaries each have a 0.3% chance (1 in 300). They are all generated in order. So when the first Legendary is generated, the next one will be different, and so on, until all 9 are minted. Multiple simulations have been run and this distribution creates a ~98% chance that all Legendaries will be minted by the time the final CosmicImpact is revealed.

### Genesis Pods ($GENESIS)


Each Genesis Pod can be minted for 1,000,000 PrimordialPepe. The option is available to burn the minted Genesis Pod and immediately mint a new one. This doesn’t cost any additional PrimordialPepe but the burned Genesis Pod will be gone forever.

This is a separate NFT in a completely different collection, but collectors will eventually be able to seed life on their CosmicImpact planets. Essentially, the Genesis Pods contain all the DNA or metadata to seed life.

Five types of DNA to be found within the Genesis Pods:

Type I (Animal)

Type II (Plant)

Type III (Fungi)

Type IV (Protist)

Type V (Monera)

These are the new base planet types that have thriving lifeforms on them. The traits for these new planets fall into one of three categories:
1/ Identical for all five planets.
2/ Similar for all five planets, bearing the same trait name.
3/ Unique trait for each planet.

There are over 1/2 million unique trait combinations to discover. Although the percentages are preset in the contract, we don’t know which traits will be drawn out by the contract on mint and permanently stamped on the blockchain. This element of surprise is what makes it a generative NFT.

## Semi-Fungible Token Descriptions

 
### Monolith Shards


Monolith Shards, are ERC1155 tokens that can be used with GenesisPods, to accelerate life on that planet into a more advanced lifeform. They are crucial in assembling Genesis Pods, which transform your planets life into evolved lifeforms. These shards are generated through the Monolith Shard Game Mechanism, specifically during weekly on-chain events.

The supply of these shards is capped at the required amount to seed life using all the GenesisPods. Indicating that only two-thirds of the $GENESIS NFTs will be seeding life if every single Monolith Shard is minted via the Monolith Shard Game Mechanism. Collectors must choose the DNA they want to use for seeding very carefully.

Participation in these weekly events, which distribute X Monolith Shards each, requires holding a genesis entity or CosmicImpact and paying 10,000 PrimordialPepe/entity. You must hold an entity at the start of the event AND at the end of the event in order to claim the Monolith Shards if you win. These events will be balanced with the distribution amount to ensure that the total supply of Monolith Shards is minted

To seed life on a planet, three Monolith Shards are combined with a Genesis Pod to assemble a full seeding pod. During assembly, your monolith fragments are effectively burned and your Genesis Pod is upgraded into an seeding pod. The DNA/metadata from the Genesis Pods remains and is now displayed on the computer screen in the seeding pod NFT.

Once you've assembled the seeding pod, you're ready to seed life on your CosmicImpact planet. The existing traits of the CosmicImpact will not influence the final evolution, only the DNA within the seeding pod. As such, the CosmicImpact enters the seeding pod, its existing traits are replaced by the ones displayed on the computer screens and contained in the Genesis Pods. The seeding pod is then burned, and life has been seeded. Note that an seeding pod can only be used once and will self-destruct (be burned) after one use.

## Staking Mechanisms


### LP Staking
 

LP staking is vital for generating PrimordialPePe (PPEPE) in our ecosystem. Users can earn PrimordialPePe rewards by staking LP tokens, specifically PrimordialPePe LP tokens. Another way to produce PrimordialPePe is by staking a PrimordialPlanet NFT.

Locking LP tokens removes them from circulation, enhancing liquidity and security within the swap protocol providing a rug resistant trading ecosystem for any meme token our community chooses to support.

PePe token holders are the first who can participate in LP staking to generate PrimordialPePe rewards, fostering community support and growth.

Staking 1 $PEPE LP Token yields 100 PrimordialPePe daily. Staking 10 $PEPE LP Tokens results in 1,000 $PPEPE per day as a reward, and so on. Each meme token that gets integrated into our system will have unique emissions providing a balanced ecosystem. Meanwhile staking 1 $PPEPE LP Token yields 1,000 $PPEPE tokens daily and staking StarDustDividends LP Tokens yields 2,000$PPEPE daily per staked token

If a user wants to increase yields in a compounding effect for a single LP Staking pool, NFTs can boost these daily yields when locked alongside the pool. These boosts take the form of 2% for the first Generation, 10% for the second Generation (Primary LP/Vesting Booster), and 5% for the third Generation. Community voting will determine the inclusion of new MeMe tokens for LP staking rewards in PrimordialPePe.


### Vesting


Vesting, a key pillar of our system, significantly contributes to the generation of PrimordialPePe. The process is governed by a timelock mechanism spanning 1 to 12 months.

While our vesting system includes specific tokens, each token follows a unique vesting rate that directly corresponds to the reward percentage based on the length of the timelock. The reward rate starts at 2% and increases 2% until month 12, of which has a posted rate of 30% instead of 24%

- PrimordialPePe $PPEPE
- PePe $PEPE
- StarDustDividends $SDIV

We understand that circumstances may arise requiring the early withdrawal of vested tokens. For such cases, we provide an emergency withdrawal option. However, be advised that choosing this path will result in forfeiting any rewards that would have been accumulated.

Furthermore, we've enhanced our vesting process by integrating NFT boosts. The extent of these boosts depends on the generation of the NFT:

- First Generation NFTs receive a 2% boost
- Second Generation NFTs receive a 10% boost
- Third Generation NFTs receive a 5% boost

## Monolith Shard Game Mechanism



The Monolith Shards Game is a groundbreaking, fully on-chain game, designed to run for a duration that allows the minted Genesis Pods supply to triple, enabling each pod to seed life on a CosmicImpact planet. Each week, users have the opportunity to hunt for Monolith Shards, with a chance to acquire up to 2 shards per game event. Each Planet costs 10,000 $PPEPE to participate in the Monolith Shard Events, and note that all $PPEPE is burned.
The Monolith Shard game harnesses the power of $PLANETS and $IMPACTS NFTs, enabling users to discover monolith shards on their planets. Every Monolith Shard is represented as an ERC1155 NFT. To participate, users must hold a $PLANETS or $IMPACTS NFT at the beginning of the event, and this same NFT must be present in the user's wallet to claim the reward. This system eliminates the need to lock the NFT, while also minimizing the gas required for participation.

The process involves a series of steps:
1. A window of time is provided, typically from Monday to Wednesday (though exact times are determined by block times and can vary each week), to pay $PPEPE and sign a transaction for participation.
2. A waiting period ensues.
3. On Friday of each week, you'll learn if you have won up to 2 Monolith Shards.
4. The weekend serves as an interval, leading into the next week's event.

Each week, 10% of the available Monolith Shards can be found - 7% are distributed across the PrimordialPlanets and 3% across the CosmicImpacts. These weekly events continue until all Monolith Shards are claimed. You MUST CLAIM your Monolith Shards to ensure they are secured. In the final week, the blockchain's workings may result in more winners than can possibly claim, leading to a competition among winners to claim their Monolith Shards.

## The PrimordialDAO


Introducing the PrimordialDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization that empowers the community to influence the integration of new Meme tokens into the LP Staking and Vesting systems for Star System Labs. Our cutting-edge governance model, fueled by the StarDustDividends token and amplified by CosmicImpacts, ensures that the decision-making process is transparent, fair, and community-driven. 

At the heart of the PrimordialDAO lies StarDustDividends ($SDIV) token, serving as the key governance instrument. As a holder of $SDIV, you become an integral part of shaping the future of Star System Labs. One $SDIV equals one vote, providing a 1:1 token/voting system based on tokens locked within the smart contract during voting periods. This decentralized approach ensures that every participant's voice is heard, democratizing the decision-making process.

The PrimordialDAO values active participation and rewards it through CosmicImpacts. By engaging with the ecosystem and demonstrating commitment, users can earn these unique digital assets. Locking a CosmicImpact during the voting period grants you a x2.5 boost to your voting weight, allowing you to have a more substantial impact on the integration of new Meme tokens.

The PrimordialDAO guarantees transparency and security throughout the voting process. When a proposal is presented, the community can lock their $SDIV tokens into the contract, signifying their support for their preferred option. The tokens remain locked until the voting period concludes, ensuring the integrity of the process and preventing undue influence. Once the vote ends, the locked tokens are promptly released back into the wallets of the voters.
